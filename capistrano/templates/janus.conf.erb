  # Janus needs this, but for most (if not all) other apps, it should be off.
  # Therefore, we put it here, to turn it on only for Janus:
  ShibUseHeaders On

  # Why we put this in a Location section:
  # "Note that Apache has complex (and unclear at times) rules for combining
  # settings across all those different sections. The SP itself doesn't impact
  # these rules; Apache is doing all the merging and evaluation and the SP
  # just performs based on the resulting merge. One particular quirk seems to
  # be that mod_rewrite can cause problems with anything but <Location>-based
  # settings. It seems to ignore settings applied based on physical path when
  # it creates subrequests, so the original request seems to have the intended
  # settings, but the rewritten request doesn't."
